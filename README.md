# Drug-MedicineReviewByPatients

# In this project, I am discovering how effective different models can perform in an ordinal categorization/regression problem. For example, amazon have products reviews under each merchandise. For me in this project, I am selecting a drug review dataset to analyze the relationship between reviews and ratings.
# The dataset I chose was originally published on “UCI Machine Learning Repository”, the following URL is my source of the dataset.
